# Project Ideas
  This is a place for me to hold project ideas. It should be a list of links to GitHub Repositories.

## Ring Doorbell Classifer
  * Build Stats of unique things your Ring has seen.

## Comic Book Classifer
  * This should be model that tells you how close to a given artist your style is.

## Update to Matt Richardson's [Descriptive Cameraâ„¢](http://mattrichardson.com/Descriptive-Camera/)
  * Can We build a Deeplearing Model that can detects objects and feed that into Text Generation Model
  * Data Sources:
      - wiki103 pre-trained
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_colors
      - Text of a Photo book

## From Facial Sketch to Description
  * Given a Facial Sketch create the language for it.
  * This could be done as Seq2Seq (Sketch to Description to Sketch)
  * Could this feed back into the Descriptive Project?
