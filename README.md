## Update to Matt Richardson's [Descriptive Cameraâ„¢](http://mattrichardson.com/Descriptive-Camera/)
  * Can We build a Deeplearing Model that can detects objects and feed that into Text Generation Model
  * Data Sources:
      - wiki103 pre-trained
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_colors
      - Text of a Photo book

## From Facial Sketch to Description
  * Given a Facial Sketch create the language for it.
  * This could be done as Seq2Seq (Sketch to Description to Sketch)
  * Could this feed back into the Descriptive Project?
